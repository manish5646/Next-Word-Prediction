# Next Word Prediction using NLP
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The model predicts the most likely next word based on a given input sequence using deep learning.


## 📌 Features
Preprocessing of text using Keras and NLTK

Tokenization and sequence generation

Training an LSTM model on the text data

Predicting the next word given an input phrase


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

TensorFlow / Keras

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib
